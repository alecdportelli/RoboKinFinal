**Final Project for Kinematics and Dynamics for Robotics Class**  
**Contributors**: A. Portelli, F. Zhang

## Description
This final project focuses on the kinematics and dynamics of robotic systems, particularly applying the Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) convention. This project includes three major components:

### Part A: Symbolic Program for D-H Parameters and Manipulator Jacobian
**Objective**: Develop a symbolic program that inputs Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) parameters for robotic manipulators and automatically derives the Jacobian matrix for the end-effector.

### Part B: Derivation & Application of Motion Equations for Robotic Systems
**Objective**: Derive the equations of motion for robots with two to six degrees of freedom, incorporating the mass and moment of inertia for each link. Apply the developed algorithms to derive equations of motion for specific robotic systems, including a double pendulum and a SCARA robot, and conduct a thorough analysis of a 6 DOF UR5 robot.

### Part C: Derivation of EOM & Demonstration
**Objective**: Derive the equations of motion for a 6 DOF UR5 robot; apply torques and show video.
