**Final Project for Kinematics and Dynamics for Robotics Class**  
**Contributors**: A. Portelli, F. Zhang

## Description
This final project focuses on the kinematics and dynamics of robotic systems, particularly applying the Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) convention. This project includes three major components:

### Part 1: Symbolic Program for D-H Parameters and Manipulator Jacobian
**Objective**: Develop a symbolic program that inputs Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) parameters for robotic manipulators and automatically derives the Jacobian matrix for the end-effector.

### Part 2: Derivation of Motion Equations for Robotic Systems
**Objective**: Derive the equations of motion for robots with two to six degrees of freedom, incorporating the mass and moment of inertia for each link.

### Part 3: Application and Analysis of the Algorithm on Specific Robots
**Objective**: Apply the developed algorithms to derive equations of motion for specific robotic systems, including a double pendulum and a SCARA robot, and conduct a thorough analysis of a 6 DOF UR5 robot.
